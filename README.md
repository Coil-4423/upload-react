When you build your Vite app using `npm run build`, the build process generates a static site. This means the output in the `build` folder contains only static files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets (e.g., images, fonts). These static files can be served by any web server without requiring Node.js on the server.

### Here's why you can upload the build folder even though it doesn’t contain Node.js:

1. **Static Site Generation**: 
   - The `npm run build` command compiles your application into static files (e.g., `index.html`, `.js` files, `.css` files) that do not require a server-side runtime like Node.js. These files are self-contained and can be served directly by a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or even basic hosting services).

2. **No Server-Side Logic**:
   - Since your app is a client-side React application, all the logic and rendering happen in the user's browser. There’s no need for a backend environment like Node.js on the server to run the app. The server’s job is simply to serve the static files to the client's browser.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - Static files generated by the build process are platform-independent. They can be served from any environment that can host files—whether that’s a traditional web server, a CDN (Content Delivery Network), or a static site hosting service.

4. **Browser-Based Execution**:
   - The JavaScript files (bundled by Vite) are executed by the browser, not the server. When a user accesses your site, the server delivers the static files, and the user's browser takes care of rendering the app using those files.

5. **Deployment Simplicity**:
   - By uploading the `build` folder to your web server, you’re deploying your app in its most optimized form. The server simply needs to handle requests for these files and deliver them to the browser. This approach simplifies deployment and reduces the server's workload since it only needs to serve static content.

### In Summary:

You can upload the `build` folder to a server because it contains everything needed for your app to run in the browser. The build process compiles and optimizes your app into static files that are ready to be served by any web server, without requiring Node.js or any other server-side runtime. This makes your app lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy.
